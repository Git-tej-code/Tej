# Understanding Where to Work?

**Many users get confused early. This page prevents that.**

**Use the Main Platform when:**

* Designing business workflows
* Managing processes, activities, and tasks
* Configuring integrations
* Managing packages and deployments

**Use Agent Builder when:**

* Creating or editing AI agents
* Testing agent behavior
* Exporting agents as APIs or tools

**Use Agent Observer when:**

* Debugging executions
* Analyzing cost or latency
* Evaluating output quality
* Reviewing audit trails

If something is not visible, it is usually due to role or scope, not a missing feature.
