# Fundamentals

AutoX is built on a clear orchestration hierarchy and a governance-first design philosophy. Understanding these fundamentals is essential before building or modifying automation, as they explain how different components fit together and why certain rules (such as versioning and immutability) exist.

This section explains the core building blocks and concepts that power AutoX.

**In this section, you will learn:**

* The orchestration hierarchy (Department → Function → Process → Activity → Task → Agent)
* What processes, activities, and tasks represent
* How agents and integrations fit into workflows
* The principles of versioning, packaging, and observability
