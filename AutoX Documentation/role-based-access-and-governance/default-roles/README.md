# Default Roles

AutoX uses a predefined set of default roles to ensure **clear ownership, controlled access, and safe governance** across the platform. Each role is designed around specific responsibilities, separating platform administration, automation design, agent development, and operational usage. Default roles determine **what actions a user can perform, which platform areas they can access, and how changes are governed**, ensuring that automation remains secure, auditable, and scalable as it moves from design to production.
