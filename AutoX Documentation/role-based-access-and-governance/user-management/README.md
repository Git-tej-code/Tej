# User Management

**How Users Are Managed?**

**Key Principles**

* Users are always assigned exactly one role
* Roles determine permissions
* Changing access requires role reassignment

&#x20;

**User Lifecycle**

1. User is created
2. Role is assigned
3. User logs in and sets password
4. All actions are audited

&#x20;

**Important Notes**

* User permissions cannot be edited individually
* Email is the primary identifier
* Deactivation retains audit history
