# Login & Platform Access

**AutoX may present multiple login entry points depending on your access:**

* Main Platform Login
* Agent Builder Login
* Agent Observer Login

**Each platform:**

* Has its own access control
* Shows only features permitted by your role
* May redirect you if access is not allowed

If you cannot log in to a platform, it means you are not authorized, not that the system is unavailable.
