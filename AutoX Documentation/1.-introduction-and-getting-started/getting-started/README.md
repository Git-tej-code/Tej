# Getting Started

Getting started with AutoX involves understanding where to log in, how access is granted, and how the platform is organized across its different interfaces. AutoX uses a role-aware, multi-entry access model that ensures users only see what they are authorized to use.

This section helps new users quickly orient themselves, log in successfully, and understand where to begin based on their role.

**In this section, you will learn:**

* How to log in to the AutoX Main Platform
* When and how to access Agent Builder and Agent Observer
* How role-based access affects navigation
