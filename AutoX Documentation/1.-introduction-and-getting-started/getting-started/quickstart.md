# Quickstart

AutoX is an enterprise automation and AI-orchestration platform designed to help organizations design, execute, observe, and govern intelligent workflows at scale.

AutoX enables teams to:

* Design structured business workflows
* Embed AI agents into operational processes
* Integrate with internal and external systems
* Safely deploy workflows across environments
* Observe execution, cost, performance, and quality

AutoX is built for governance-first automation, where:

* Versioning is automatic and immutable
* Access is controlled through roles and attributes
* Observability is not optional, but foundational
