# Versioning & Safety

1. **Why can’t I delete processes, activities, or packages?**

Deletion breaks audit trails and compliance.

AutoX uses archiving and versioning instead.

&#x20;

2. **How do I roll back a change?**

Deploy a previously stable package version.

Rollback is a redeployment, not an undo.
