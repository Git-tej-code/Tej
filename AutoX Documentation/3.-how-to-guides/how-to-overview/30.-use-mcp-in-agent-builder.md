# 30. Use MCP in Agent Builder

Agent Builder has native integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard that allows AI models to securely interact with local and remote resources. Agent Builder acts as both a Client and a Server.

**1. Using Agent Builder as an MCP Client**

You can give your Agents access to external MCP tools (like a local database, file system, or GitHub repository).

* MCP Component: Use the MCP Tools component in your canvas.
* Connection: You can connect to an external MCP server by providing its SSE URL or stdio command in the settings page.
* Agent Integration: Connect the output of the MCP Tools component to the "Tools" input of an AI Agent component. The Agent can now autonomously call these external tools during a conversation.

**2. Using Agent Builder as an MCP Server**

You can expose your Agent Builder flows as tools for other MCP clients (like Claude Desktop or Cursor).

* Exposing Agents: In your Project Settings or the "Share" menu, select MCP Server.
* Tool Definition: Mark specific Agents as "Tools." You must ensure these agents have clear names and descriptions, as the external AI will use this metadata to decide when to call them.
* Consumption: Once enabled, your Agent Builder project provides an MCP endpoint. You can configure Claude Desktop or other MCP-compliant apps to connect to this endpoint, effectively giving Claude the ability to "run" your custom Agent Builder workflows as if they were native functions.
