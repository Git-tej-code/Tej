2. Model Breakdown: Analyze the Model Costs widget to identify spending drivers:

* Compare Models: See the cost difference between models (e.g., gpt-4o vs. gpt-4.1).
* Token Volume: Verify the volume of tokens consumed.
* Unit Economics: Track the exact USD value per model.

3. Analyze Trends: Use the Model Usage charts to spot unusual spikes in consumption that may indicate inefficiencies or high traffic.
