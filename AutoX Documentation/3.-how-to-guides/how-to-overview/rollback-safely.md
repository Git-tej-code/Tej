# Rollback Safely

**Who can do this**

* Platform Admin
* Power User (with deployment permission)

&#x20;

**Rollback Method**

AutoX does not modify deployed packages.

To roll back:

1. Identify a previous stable Package
2. Deploy that package to the target environment

&#x20;

**What Happens Next**

* Stable versions are restored
* No existing package is altered
* Audit trail is preserved

&#x20;

**Important Notes**

* Rollback is a redeployment, not a reversal
* All deployments are traceable
* This ensures compliance and safety
