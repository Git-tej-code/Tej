# First Login

First login to AutoX is designed to help you **orient quickly**, understand your **role-based access**, and identify **where you should start working**. AutoX automatically tailors the interface based on the roles assigned to you.

***

#### What Happens on First Login

When you log in for the first time:

* Your **role and permissions** are validated
* You are redirected to the **Main Platform dashboard** (or allowed entry point)
* Navigation items are shown **only for features you can access**
* Restricted modules (Agent Builder, Agent Observer) remain hidden unless permitted

No manual setup is required from your side.

***

#### What You Will See

Depending on your role, you may see access to:

* Departments and Functions
* Processes and Scheduler
* Agent Builder
* Agent Observer
* Integrations
* Settings and Profile

This is expected behavior—AutoX intentionally hides features you are not authorized to use.

***

#### What You Should Do First

On your first login, it is recommended to:

1. Review the **navigation menu** to understand available modules
2. Open **My Profile** to verify your user details
3. Identify your **starting area**:
   * Business Users → View executions and outcomes
   * Power Users → Explore processes and workflows
   * Agent Developers → Open Agent Builder
   * Admins → Review users, roles, and settings

***

#### If Something Looks Missing

If you cannot see a feature you expect:

* Your role may not include access
* Access may be limited by organization or environment

Contact a **Platform Admin** to review your role assignment.

***

#### Important Notes

* AutoX does not allow unrestricted access by default
* All access is governed and audited
* Changes to roles may require you to log out and log back in
